### Project 1: Visualization of Aluminum Alloy Compositions
---
Created visualizations of the composition-space for registered cast and wrought aluminum alloys. Composition limits from 920 registered aluminum alloys were gathered from Aluminum Association registration documents (i.e., Teal Sheets, Pink Sheets). Project involved manipulating 3-dimensional PCA to better represent the data in 2 dimensions, and creating an interactive 3D plot to better explore the similarities between aluminum alloy families.
